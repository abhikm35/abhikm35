🧠 About Me
🔭 I’m currently working on streamlining EDA tool workflows @ Sharc Lab

🌱 Currently learning about GPU Architecture, OS, EDA Synthesis tools

🧩 Interested in hardware-software co-design, system-level simulation, and computer architecture

💬 Ask me about FPGAs, VHDL/SystemVerilog, or verification flows
⚙️ Tools I often use: Vivado, Quartus, Cadence Xcelium, Synopsys VCS, C++, Linux

📈 Outside of engineering, I enjoy listening/playing jazz on my saxophone, working out, and playing/watching soccer (❤💙 𝔽ℂ 𝔹𝕒𝕣𝕔𝕖𝕝𝕠𝕟𝕒 💙❤)
